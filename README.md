This is the start of a new language I'm going to make. The basic idea is outlined in [concept.txt](concept.txt).

It will be dynamically typed (however not all variables can be `nil`) and will compile to bytecode. A large amount
of code will probably be borrowed from [Pluto](https://github.com/pluto-language/pluto) since the syntax is similar-ish
and there's a lot of boilerplate.

If anyone wants to help, [send me an email](mailto:me@zacgarby.co.uk) or add an issue, or anything really.
